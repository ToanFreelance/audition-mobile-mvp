# MVP Entry Flow V1 — Character → Rooms → Waiting Room → Game

Owner decision (2026-10-09): **defer S2.5B Football Field, Classroom, Café** and prioritize
an end-to-end user journey on the existing app. No new project, no new stage,
no Stage Selector S3, and no gameplay architecture changes.

## Routes / smoke path

1. `/character/create`: choose an accepted runtime-ready character,
   customize name/appearance and tap **TẠO NHÂN VẬT**; save an existing
   `audition.characterCreationDraft.v1` localStorage draft.
2. Tap **TIẾP TỤC → SẢNH PHÒNG** to open `/rooms`.
   Device-stable `player-<UUID>` is created in localStorage (MVP-only).
3. `/rooms`: create an authoritative room with the profile's name and
   `characterAssetId`, choose a recent waiting room from the room list,
   or join by `mvp-*` code. Joining reserves an open slot through the
   existing room CAS API (revision conflict is retried).
4. `/rooms/[roomId]`: validate current local participant membership against
   canonical RoomState GET, then mount the existing WaitingRoomPanel with
   `initialRoom`, actual `participantId` and host/guest role.
5. Existing server-authoritative Ready → Host Start → preload →
   countdown/shared epoch → multiplayer gameplay remains unchanged.
   A guest who leaves goes back to `/rooms`; the Host back button
   returns to the browser but does not close/transfer the room.

## Data and security boundaries

- New `POST /api/multiplayer/room` action `create` creates unique
  server-assigned `mvp-<random>` rooms and validates Character Catalog
  runtime identity. The bootstrap RPC preserves atomic insert-if-absent.
- `GET /api/multiplayer/room?browse=1` returns public summaries only.
  The added `public.list_mvp_lobby_rooms()` SQL function is
  read-only, `SECURITY DEFINER SET search_path=''` with schema-qualified
  source, scoped EXECUTE grants and returns only room code/name, mode,
  player count, capacity and open slots. It restricts results to waiting
  `mvp-*` rooms updated in the last 72 hours (max 60 results). It does
  **not** expose historical QA rooms or raw participant snapshots.
  `public.lobby_rooms` table RLS and existing CAS RPCs remain intact.
- The migration `20261009020000_mvp_room_browser_public_summaries.sql`
  was applied to the existing Supabase project; no new database project
  or direct table grant to the browser.
- The old `/tools/lobby-qa` demo retains QA bootstrap and fixed
  fixture participants. Entry Flow never substitutes QA avatars for
  a removed member, nor auto-bootstraps a missing room.
- Local character draft and stable device participant ID are **not auth**.
  They can be edited by the user and cannot prevent identity spoofing.
  Persisted account/character ownership, login/session authorization,
  abuse rate limiting, host leave/close lifecycle and broader production
  room discovery must be designed in Phase 7/hardening before public launch.
- The MVP browser previews rooms, **not** a full social matchmaking service.

## Validation gates

- Vercel Next.js + TypeScript build and route manifest.
- Supabase schema/RPC/grants verified by read-only SQL.
- Playwright spec added for first-user prompt, creator→browser CTA
  and rejecting QA room identifiers. Do not report tests as executed
  until a runner actually executes them.
- Owner should test Safari portrait on two devices:
  Device A create/save character, create room, verify Host name/model.
  Device B create a different character, join via code/list, verify
  distinct avatar/name and slot in both clients, Ready/Start and
  matched gameplay. Test tab background/foreground and guest leave.
- No changes to WebAudio/global turn/gauge/Finish/sequenceCounts,
  CAS/Realtime protocol, preload epoch or Stage3D character architecture.

## Integration policy

Branch: `work/mvp-entry-room-flow-v1`.
Keep a draft PR against `development` until owner iPhone acceptance.
No merge of `development` or `main` without owner approval.
